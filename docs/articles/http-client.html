<h1 id="querying-the-google-safe-browsing-api">Querying The Google Safe Browsing API</h1>

<p>Querying the Google Safe Browsing API simply means that you want to manually query the Google Safe Browsing API REST
endpoints and handle the responses yourself. This gives you the most flexibility on how you want to handle the data
provided by the Google Safe Browsing API however it does mean that you would need to, effectively, implement the
<a href="https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/v4/update-api">Google Safe Browsing Update API</a> protocol yourself. Safe
Browsing.NET has an HTTP client, aptly named
<a class="xref" href="../api/Gee.External.Browsing.Clients.Http.HttpBrowsingClient.html">HttpBrowsingClient</a>, that you can use to query the Google
Safe Browsing API.</p>
<div class="WARNING">
<h5>Warning</h5>
<p>Safe Browsing.NET <strong>only implements</strong> the
<a href="https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/v4/update-api">Google Safe Browsing Update API</a>. It
<strong>does not implement</strong> the
<a href="https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/v4/lookup-api">Google Safe Browsing Lookup API</a>. As such, the only
methods declared by <code>HttpBrowsingClient</code> are the ones that relevant to the Google Safe Browsing Update API.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="how-to-retrieve-available-threat-list-descriptors">How To: Retrieve Available Threat List Descriptors</h2>
<p>Threat lists are Google's constantly updated lists of unsafe web resources. Examples of unsafe web resources are social
engineering sites (deceptive and phishing sites) and sites that host malware or unwanted software. Threat lists are
identified using a <a class="xref" href="../api/Gee.External.Browsing.ThreatListDescriptor.html">ThreatListDescriptor</a>. A threat list is identified
using a <a class="xref" href="../api/Gee.External.Browsing.ThreatType.html">ThreatType</a>, which indicates the nature of its associated threats, a
<a class="xref" href="../api/Gee.External.Browsing.PlatformType.html">PlatformType</a>, which indicates the platform its associated threats target,
and a <a class="xref" href="../api/Gee.External.Browsing.ThreatEntryType.html">ThreatEntryType</a>, which indicates how its associated threats is
posed.</p>
<p>Once you have a collection of available threat lists descriptors, you can then use them to further query the Google
Safe Browsing API and retrieve the threats that are associated with them.</p>
<h2 id="retrieving-threat-list-updates">Retrieving Threat List Updates</h2>
<p>Retrieving threat list updates refers to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Querying the Google Safe Browsing API for a collection of threats associated with one or more threat lists</li>
<li>Storing those threats in a database (herein referred to as a threat database) for a specified time</li>
<li>Subsequently querying the Google Safe Browsing API again, in periodic intervals, for updates to those threat lists
you initially retrieved.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Retrieved threats are identified using a SHA256 hash (herein referred to as threat hash prefix) that is between 4 to
32 bytes in length. Safe Browsing.NET encodes threat hash prefixes in hexadecimal for simplified handling and
identification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The intent of a threat database is so that after you set it up, you can query it, instead of the Google Safe Browsing
API, to determine if a URL is safe or unsafe. The implementation of a threat database could be anything you choose
(e.g. in-memory data structure, SQLite, SQL Server, et al.)</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Safe Browsing.NET has out-of-the-box implementations for an in-memory threat database and a file based threat
database that is persisted to disk as JSON. These implementations should satisfy the majority of use cases if you do
not want to implement your own threat database. For more information, please see
<a class="xref" href="../api/Gee.External.Browsing.Databases.Json.ManagedJsonBrowsingDatabase.html">ManagedJsonBrowsingDatabase</a> and
<a class="xref" href="../api/Gee.External.Browsing.Databases.MemoryBrowsingDatabase.html">MemoryBrowsingDatabase</a> in the
<a class="xref" href="../api/Gee.External.Browsing.html">Safe Browsing.NET API reference</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Threat list updates are retrieved as either <em>full</em> or as <em>partial</em> updates. A <em>full update</em> means you want to retrieve
a threat list in its entirety. A <em>partial update</em> means you want to retrieve updates to a threat list since the last
time you retrieved it as a <em>full update</em>.</p>
<h3 id="learn-full-vs-partial-threat-list-updates">Learn: Full vs. Partial Threat List Updates</h3>
<p>When you retrieve a threat list from the Google Safe Browsing API, you have the option to retrieve it as either a full
or a partial update. Retrieving a threat list as a full update refers to retrieving it in its entirety. In other words,
you want to retrieve all of its associated threats as of the time you send the request.</p>
<p>Retrieving a threat list as a partial update refers to retrieving only updates to it since the last time you retrieved
it as a full update. In other words, you want to retrieve a computed difference between your local copy of the threat
list and Google's remote copy of the threat list as of the time you send the request. The computed difference will
indicate which of the threat list's associated threats you <strong>must</strong> remove from and which threats you <strong>must</strong> add to
your local copy of the threat list.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>As a rule of thumb, the first time you retrieve a threat list, you will always retrieve it as a full update.
Subsequently, with very few exceptions, you will always retrieve it as a partial update.</p>
</div>
<div class="WARNING">
<h5>Warning</h5>
<p>Technically, there is nothing stopping you from retrieving a threat list as a full update every time or any time you
want. Doing so, however, is an incredible waste of resources.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="learn-what-is-a-threat-list-checksum">Learn: What is a Threat List Checksum?</h3>
<p>When you retrieve a threat list from the Google Safe Browsing API, regardless of whether it is retrieved as a full or
partial update, the returned response includes a <code>checksum</code> (herein referred to as <code>threat list checksum</code> or a <code>threat list's checksum</code>). A <code>threat list's checksum</code> is used to verify your local copy of the threat list after you store it
in your threat database.</p>
<p>After you store a retrieved threat list in your threat database, you <strong>must</strong> compute its <code>checksum</code> and compare it
with the <code>checksum</code> included in the response. If the two values match, your local copy of the threat list is considered
correct. If the two values do not match, your local copy of the threat list is considered corrupt. If your local copy
of the threat list is corrupt, you <strong>must</strong> disregard (i.e. delete it from your threat database) it in its entirety and
retrieve it again as a full update.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Safe Browsing.NET expresses a <code>threat list's checksum</code> as a hexadecimal encoded string.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="how-to-compute-a-threat-list-checksum">How To: Compute a Threat List Checksum</h4>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>If you use one of the threat databases provided out-of-the-box by Safe Browsing.NET, such as
<a class="xref" href="../api/Gee.External.Browsing.Databases.MemoryBrowsingDatabase.html">MemoryBrowsingDatabase</a>, there is an extension method
to compute a <code>threat list's checksum</code> so that you don't have to do it yourself. For more information, please see
<a href="xref:Gee.External.Browsing.Databases.BrowsingDatabaseExtension">BrowsingDatabaseExtension</a> in the
<a class="xref" href="../api/Gee.External.Browsing.html">Safe Browsing.NET API reference</a>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="learn-what-is-a-threat-list-state">Learn: What is a Threat List State?</h3>
<p>When you retrieve a threat list from the Google Safe Browsing API, regardless of whether it is retrieved as a full or
partial update, the returned response includes a <code>state</code> (herein referred to as <code>threat list state</code> or a <code>threat list's state</code>). A <code>threat list's state</code> is an opaque value indicating a snapshot in time when it was retrieved.</p>
<p>The first time you retrieve a threat list, you will always retrieve it as a full update. This is accomplished by not
including a <code>threat list state</code> in the request to the Google Safe Browsing API. You <strong>must</strong> store the retrieved
<code>threat list's state</code>, preferably in your threat database, that is included in the returned response so that you can
subsequently retrieve the threat list as a partial update. This is accomplished by including the retrieved <code>threat list's state</code> in the subsequent request to the Google Safe Browsing API.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>As a rule of thumb, to retrieve a threat list as a full update, you <strong>must</strong> not include a <code>threat list state</code> in the
request to the Google Safe Browsing API. To retrieve a threat list as a partial update, you <strong>must</strong> include a
<code>threat list state</code> in the request.</p>
</div>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Even though a <code>threat list's state</code> is an opaque value, Safe Browsing.NET expresses it as a hexadecimal encoded
string.</p>
</div>
<div class="WARNING">
<h5>Warning</h5>
<p>As a rule of thumb, you <strong>must</strong> store a retrieved <code>threat list's state</code>, preferably in your threat database. If you
do not, you will never be able to subsequently retrieve the threat list as a partial update.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="learn-what-are-threat-list-update-constraints">Learn: What are Threat List Update Constraints?</h3>
<p>When you retrieve a threat list from the Google Safe Browsing API, regardless of whether it is retrieved as a full or
partial update, you have the option to include update constraints in the request to the Google Safe Browsing API to
limit the size of the data set or restrict the data set to a specific criteria that is included in the response. The
data set included in the response is, effectively, the threats associated with the threat list.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>To better understand what update constraints you can include in a request to the Google Safe Browsing API, please see
<a class="xref" href="../api/Gee.External.Browsing.Clients.ThreatListUpdateConstraintsBuilder.html">ThreatListUpdateConstraintsBuilder</a> in the
<a class="xref" href="../api/Gee.External.Browsing.html">Safe Browsing.NET API reference</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="WARNING">
<h5>Warning</h5>
<p>As a rule of thumb, limiting the size of the data set included in a response from the Google Safe Browsing API
<strong>will</strong> impact the effectiveness of the protection provided by the Google Safe Browsing API. You <strong>should only</strong>
limit the size of the data set if you have resource constraints, such as memory. Typically, if you're building an
application that will run on a PC or a server, you should not have resource constraints. For more information, please
see the <a href="https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/v4/update-constraints">Google Safe Browsing API documentation</a>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="learn-what-is-a-threat-list-wait-to-date">Learn: What is a Threat List Wait to Date?</h3>
<p>When you retrieve a threat list from the Google Safe Browsing API, regardless of whether it is retrieved as a full or
partial update, the returned response might optionally include a <code>wait to date</code> (herein referred to as a <code>threat list's wait to date</code>). A <code>threat list's wait to date</code> is the date you <strong>must</strong> wait to before subsequently retrieving the
threat list again.</p>
<p>After you retrieve a threat list, you <strong>must</strong> store its <code>wait to date</code>,  preferably in your threat database, and avoid
subsequently retrieving the threat list again until its <code>wait to date</code> has expired. A typical implementation approach
to doing this might be to setup a timer that expires when the <code>threat list's wait to date</code> expires.</p>
<div class="IMPORTANT">
<h5>Important</h5>
<p>Technically, there is nothing stopping you from subsequently retrieving a threat list before its <code>wait to date</code>.
Doing so however, might subject your account to being disabled by Google. For more information, please see the
<a href="https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/v4/request-frequency#minimum-wait-duration">Google Safe Browsing API documentation</a>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="how-to-retrieve-full-threat-list-updates">How To: Retrieve Full Threat List Updates</h3>
<p>Retrieving a threat list as a full update refers to retrieving it in its entirety. In other words, you want to retrieve
all of its associated threats as of the time you send the request.</p>
<div class="NOTE">

<p>The first time you retrieve a threat list, you will always retrieve it as a full update.</p>
</div>
<p>After you retrieve a threat list as a full update, you <strong>should</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you already have a local copy of it in your threat database, disregard it (i.e. delete it from your threat
database) in its entirety</li>
<li>Store a local copy of it in your threat database, including its <code>state</code> and <code>wait to date</code></li>
<li>Compute your local copy's <code>checksum</code> and compare it to the <code>checksum</code> included in the response from the Google Safe
Browsing API. If the two values match, your local copy is considered correct. If the two values do not match, your
local copy is considered corrupt. If your local copy is corrupt, you must disregard (i.e. delete it from your threat
database) it in its entirety and retrieve it again as a full update</li>
<li>Subsequently, when you retrieve the threat list again, retrieve it as a partial update unless it becomes corrupt</li>
<li>Refrain from subsequently retrieving the threat list again until its <code>wait to date</code> expires</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="how-to-retrieve-partial-threat-list-updates">How To: Retrieve Partial Threat List Updates</h3>
<p>Retrieving a threat list as a partial update refers to retrieving only updates to it since the last time you retrieved
it as a full update. In other words, you want to retrieve a computed difference between your local copy of the threat
list and Google's remote copy of the threat list as of the time you send the request. The computed difference will
indicate which of the threat list's associated threats you <strong>must</strong> remove from and which threats you <strong>must</strong> add to
your local copy of the threat list.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>You cannot retrieve a threat list as a partial update if you have never retrieved it as a full update.</p>
</div>
<p>After you retrieve a threat list as a partial update, you <strong>should</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the response from the Google Safe Browsing API includes a collection of threats to remove:
<ol>
<li>Lexicographically sort your local copy of the threat list if its not already sorted</li>
<li>Delete the threats included in the response for removal from your local copy</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If the response includes a collection of threats to add, add them to your local copy</li>
<li>Update your local copy's <code>state</code> and <code>wait to date</code> with the values included in the response</li>
<li>Compute your local copy's <code>checksum</code> and compare it to the <code>checksum</code> included in the response from the Google Safe
Browsing API. If the two values match, your local copy is considered correct. If the two values do not match, your
local copy is considered corrupt. If your local copy is corrupt, you must disregard (i.e. delete it from your threat
database) it in its entirety and retrieve it again as a full update</li>
<li>Subsequently, when you retrieve the threat list again, retrieve it as a partial update unless it becomes corrupt</li>
<li>Refrain from subsequently retrieving the threat list again until its <code>wait to date</code> expires</li>
